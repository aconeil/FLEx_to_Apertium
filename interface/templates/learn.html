			<h2>Apertium for language technology</h2>
			<p>Apertium is an open-source tool for machine translation. This page describes the
				applications of Apertium, available resources for learning more information, and outlines
				of various files associated with Apertium modules.</p>
			<h3>I. Applications of Apertium</h3>
			<p>Apertium has a wide range of applications for the creation of language technology.
			Morphological analysis and morphological generation are built into the module and can be tested
			using just the lexicon file and running ```make``` in a bootstrapped repository. This website is
			also currently developing the ability to test the analysis and generation functions. Additionally,
			the module can be further developed to create a spell-checker for the language or an automatic part-
			of-speech tagger that can be used in the syntactic analysis of the language. Some existing works have
			also used Apertium to develop Automatic Speech Recognition models for a language. Further, monolingual
			Apertium modules can be expanded into bilingual Apertium modules, allowing for translation between
			language pairs.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>II. Resources for further information</h3>
			<p>Further information about what Apertium is and how you can use and contribute to Apertium can be
			found on the <a href="https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Main_Page">Apertium Wiki Website</a>. Additionally,
			for specific information about how to make lexd files, see the documentation found on
				<a href="https://github.com/apertium/lexd/blob/main/Usage.md">this page</a>. Detailed information about
			twol files can be found in
				<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210416005021/https://web.stanford.edu/~laurik/.book2software/twolc.pdf">
					this book</a>.</p>

			<h3>III. Introduction to Apertium files</h3>
			<p></p>
			<br>
			<h4>i. Lexicon File</h4>
			<p>Lexicon files in Apertium can take different format. This program exports to the lexd format
			due to the format's ability to handle concatenative and non-suffixational morphology well. There are two basic
			things to consider when writing a lexicon file: Patterns and Lexicon. Patterns include information about
			which pieces of language can go together. The lexicon includes the information about what those individual
			pieces are.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>ii. Rule File</h4>
			Information about how to write and edit twol rules is coming soon!
